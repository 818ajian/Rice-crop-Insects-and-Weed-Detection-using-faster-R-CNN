# INSECTS AND  WEED DETECTION FROM RICE CROP FIELD USING FASTERR-CNN

## Abstract


As the increase in the world population the demand of the rice is also increases. In order to increase the growth of rice in the rice crop it is necessary to detect the weed and insects in thericecroptominimizethegrowthofweedandinsectssothatthegrowthofthericecan be increased.Insect and Weed detection is the important factor to be analyzed. Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) is used for data acquisition of rice crop in different phases and states so that high quality of RGB images can be captured in which has taken 15 different types of rice crop insects images and different phases of weed images to train the model. The proposedmethodfacilitatestheextractionofweedandinsectsintothericecropﬁeldusing faster region-baseconvolutional neural networks(FasterR-CNNs)itis implemented using Python3. The result shows that Faster R-CNN method is very good for detection and classiﬁcation the weed and insects with good accuracy rate.


## Problem Statement


 Objects contained in image ﬁles can be located and identiﬁed automatically. This is called object detection and is one of the basic problems of computer vision. As we will demonstrate, region-base convolutional neural networks(Faster R-CNN) are currently the state-of-theart solution for object detection. The main task of this thesis is to detection and classification of rice crop insects and weed into rice crop field with the help of images and videos which is taken by UAV


## User Manual 


In order to excess project people need to go insize models directory in which we will find some short of directory from them we need to find research directory and then we need to find object detection directory and after that  all these hierarchical directories we need to flow the instruction given on that page README.md. Again, i am showing steps here which we need to flow them in order to use/excess this project source code.

Step 1 : Open models directory
Step 2 : Open research directory
Step 3 : Open object_detection directory
Step 4 : Flow the steps given on that page README.md

Thank a lot and Regards
